Infix to Postfix Converter
This is a simple web application that converts infix expressions to postfix notation. Infix notation is the standard arithmetic and logical formula notation, such as "3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5)", while postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), places operators after their operands, for example, "3 4 2 * 1 5 - / +".

Usage:
1.	Enter the infix expression you want to convert into the input field.
2.	Click the "Convert" button.
3.	The postfix expression will be displayed below the input field.

Technologies Used:

•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript


How It Works:
•	The application defines a set of operators and their precedence.
•	It uses a stack-based algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix notation.
•	The conversion is performed in real-time when the user clicks the "Convert" button.
